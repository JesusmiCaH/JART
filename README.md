# JART
Code of my dissertation design, referring to ViT from Dosovitskiy A, Beyer L, Kolesnikov A, et al. JART represents Jiang Action Recognition Transformer, which is a Transformer for image classification tasks. JART has showed excellent performance in UCF101 dataset.
## How to run the code  
Download UCF-101jpg dataset(not original UCF101) from [here](https://featurize.cn/datasets/94f932dc-fab1-4209-90bf-d2bf9516306e), then change ```train_list_path``` in train.py to the path where you save your UCF101 dataset. Then **just run it**!!!
